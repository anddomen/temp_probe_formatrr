## temp_probe_formatrr

This app and associated script is for collating multiple temperature probe .xlsx files into one.

There is a standalone R Script that accomplishes this (temp_probe_formatrr_nonGUI.R) and a GUI version for my non-R using lab mates. When everything is finished I will update this README on how to use both.

I made this for my lab mates that either aren't comfortable with R or just dont' want to mess with it. This will hopefully be a huge time saver for them and be kinder on their computer RAMs :)
